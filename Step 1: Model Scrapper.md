### Reasoning
* url can be easily modified by champ name + skin number
* need to somehow come up with a combination of this to generate each url
* this will allow me to vist every single model page, and title the screenshots appropriately

### Challenges
* need to examine the html better (almost scrapped champ names and made it harder for myself), there was a js script that the website already had compiled with the matching url and name of skin
  * luckily in the script, there is a dictionary variable with every single skin and it's url identifier
*  issues with punctuation in names. Originally split by ",", but turns out there was a skin name with a comma
